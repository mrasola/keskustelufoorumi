# Discussion Forum

This is a simple discussion forum. The forum has (will have) basic 
operations such as logging in, opening a new thread, answering to thread,
modifying a message, reading messages etc. It will also be possible to 
search messages. There are categories that can be assigned to a message.
It will be possible to filter messages by category. Categories are managed by 
administrators. Administrators can delete and modify any message if 
necessary. 

## Existing functionality:

Signing in and registration   
Normal users and admins  
Admins cannot just register: admin rights are given manually  
Opening a thread (making a message)   
Writing messages  
Removing/modifying messages    
Categorizing messages  
Adding/editing/removing of categories for admins

## To be implemented  

Searching messages and users  
Answering to a thread (message)  
Better interactivity: helping pop-up messages for user etc.   

### For testing use:
Username: mrasola or tviivi  
Password: tuitui or moimoi (respectively)

Note:   
It is also possible to register as a new user. This can also be used for
testing, however, making multiple new test accounts is not preferred.
