# Discussion Forum

This is a simple discussion forum. The forum has basic operations such
as logging in, opening a new thread, answering to thread, modifying 
a message, reading messages etc. It will also be possible to search 
messages.

## Functionality:

Signing in and registration   
Opening a thread  
Searching messages (and maybe users)    
Writing messages  
Removing/modifying messages  
Categorizing

### For testing use:
Username: mrasola or tviivi  
Password: tuitui or moimoi (respectively)

Note:   
It is also possible to register as a new user. This can also be used for
testing, however, making multiple new test accounts is not preferred.
