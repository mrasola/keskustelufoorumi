# Shortages

The application as such is quite easily broadened to any level. However, 
multiple features should be added for proper usability. Such as:

- Searching messages and users  
- More stuff to the statistics page
- Answering to a thread (message)  
- Better interactivity: helping pop-up messages for user etc.   
- Password protection
- Better validation, now its possible to have two identical users=not good
- Dates could be added here and there
