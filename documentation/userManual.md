# User manual

This is a short manual for using Miquel's forum. 

##### New user

You can make yourself a normal user account by registering as a new user 
from the upper right corner link "Register". If you do not want to write 
messages (or comment in the future) you can just use the forum for reading 
what others have written without registering.

You can read messages from the "All messages" page. This page list all the 
messages. You can read a specific message by clicking the message subject 
from the list.

##### Registered user

Once registered as depicted above you can write messages in the "All messages" 
page by clicking "Add a new message" or by clicking "Add a new message" in the 
navigation bar. You can choose categories from the list in the message form for 
your message. You don't have to choose any. 

Editing or deleting messages is straightforward in the "All messages" page. 
Just click the message as you would when reading it and click "Delete"  or 
"Edit" below the message text. Note that "Delete" just deletes the message 
straight away and completely: be shure when clicking,

##### Admin

If you have admin privileges you can also add, edit and delete categories in
the "Categories" page once logged in. (Logging in is the same procedure as for
any user.) It is straightforward to add a gategory by clicking "Add a category"
in the page. Editing or removing categories happens similarly to messages: go
to "Categories", click category in the list and choose "Edit" or "Delete" in the 
bottom of the page.
